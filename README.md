Realisation of a naval combat game in the simplest variant.

I wanted to make a project with a graphical interface and pygame was perfect for this + I liked this game in my childhood.

I specially made all properties in all classes public, did not write setters getters, it is assumed that the interaction will be only with the window of the game itself

You can run the main.py file and play. The computer will make a move after every click of your mouse.
